# Audio_Recognition_DL
Projecte Final Deep Learning 

The Database of audios we created for this project is too large so we leave the link of the 
drive folder where there are all the audios and the link of the folder where there are 
all the Spectograms so you don't have to run all the code to create the spectograms
as it takes a lot of time.

Audios and matrices: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ud5xCLNe8ciY91q6HSHGfEO9ym8pYMGQ?usp=sharing

Spectograms: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qqSjVETtAg10H9Ed_-IJI6PzcbgkXw2o?usp=sharing

You only have access with UPF accounts.

In the Results folder you should find the model already trained.
